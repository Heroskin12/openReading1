Hi. Thank you for checking out openReading.

openReading. is a project I built to solve some problems I have dealt with in my career in education.
Firstly, creating lessons takes a lot of work. From coming up with ideas, to sourcing or potentially creating the necessary materials, and then implementing them...imagine doing that 20 times a week!

openReading. solves part of this issue. Instead of meandering about the internet trying to find free, good-quality and suitable materials for their students, teachers can instead fill out a simple form and receive an auto-generated text on a topic of their choosing.

Want to learn more about Dumbledore from Harry Potter? No problem. Just type in Dumbledore as the topic, choose the age range of your students, level and other parameters, to receive the text within a minute. The website also supports texts in many different languages. Just choose the one you want!

The website works by leveraging the openAi api. Depending on connection speeds, texts can take up to a minute to generate.

Please acknowledge that the site is a work in progress.
I am adding new features as and when I can.

Some of my future plans for the website include:
    - Generating lesson plans for teachers.
    - Creating vocabulary, grammar and punctuation exercises.
    - Publishing free texts for all ages on a daily basis.
    - Parsing and formatting the openAi text response so it looks nicer when generated.
    - Allowing users to download the generated text. Currently, it is only possible to copy and paste.
    - Adjustments to the UI.
    - More paramaters to further customise the texts.
